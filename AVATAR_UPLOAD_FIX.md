# Avatar Upload Fix - Issue Resolution

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **RLS Policy Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Storage RLS policies expected folder structure (`user-id/filename`) but code uploaded flat files (`user-id-timestamp.ext`)
- **Symptom**: Upload requests denied due to policy mismatch

### 2. **Server Action File Handling**
- **Problem**: Server actions cannot directly receive File objects from client components
- **Symptom**: File data lost during server action call

### 3. **Insufficient Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Upload failures were silently ignored, continuing without avatar
- **Symptom**: No visible error messages when uploads failed

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed RLS Policies** (`20250924000014_fix_avatar_storage_policies.sql`)
```sql
-- New policy that works with flat file structure
create policy "Authenticated users can upload avatars"
on storage.objects for insert
with check (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND starts_with(name, auth.uid()::text)
);
```

### 2. **Updated Server Action** (`lib/actions/onboarding.ts`)
- Changed from `OnboardingFormData` to `FormData` parameter
- Proper file extraction: `formData.get('avatarFile') as File`
- Enhanced validation and error handling
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 3. **Updated Form Component** (`components/onboarding-form.tsx`)
- Convert form data to `FormData` before server action call
- Proper file attachment: `submitData.append('avatarFile', formData.avatarFile)`

### 4. **Added Debug Utilities** (`lib/utils/debug-avatar.ts`)
- Comprehensive file validation
- Detailed logging for development troubleshooting
- Better error messages

## 🚀 How It Works Now

1. **User uploads image** → Avatar component processes and crops
2. **Form submission** → Creates FormData with file attachment
3. **Server action** → Receives FormData, extracts file properly
4. **File validation** → Checks type, size, and content
5. **Supabase upload** → Uploads to `avatars` bucket with proper naming
6. **URL generation** → Gets public URL for database storage
7. **Profile update** → Saves avatar URL to profiles table
8. **Success feedback** → User sees confirmation and redirects to dashboard

## 🔧 Key Changes Made

- **Migration**: Fixed storage RLS policies to match file naming pattern
- **Server Action**: Proper FormData handling with comprehensive error reporting
- **Form Component**: FormData creation and submission
- **Debug Utils**: Development logging and validation helpers
- **Error Handling**: Fails fast with clear error messages instead of silent failures

## 📝 Testing Instructions

1. Run onboarding flow
2. Upload an avatar image
3. Check browser console for debug logs (development mode)
4. Verify image appears in Supabase Storage `avatars` bucket
5. Verify `photo_url` field populated in profiles table
6. Confirm avatar shows in header dropdown

The avatar upload should now work reliably with proper error feedback and debugging capabilities.
